	of a wide spectrum of biotechnology applications. In recent years,
	new high-throughput genotyping technologies have substantially increased
	the density and diversity of genetic markers, creating new algorithmic
	challenges for computational biologists. In this paper, we present
	a novel algorithmic method to construct genetic maps based on a new
	theoretical insight. Our approach outperforms the best methods available
	in the scientific literature, particularly when the input data are
	noisy or incomplete.</p>},
